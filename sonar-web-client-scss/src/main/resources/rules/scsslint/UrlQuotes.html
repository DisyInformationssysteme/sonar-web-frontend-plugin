<p>URLs should always be enclosed within quotes.</p><p><strong>Bad: no enclosing quotes</strong></p><div class="highlight highlight-scss"><pre>background: url(example<span class="pl-e">.png</span>);</pre></div><p><strong>Good</strong></p><div class="highlight highlight-scss"><pre>background: url('example<span class="pl-e">.png</span>');</pre></div><p>Using quoted URLs is consistent with using other Sass asset helpers, which also
expect quoted strings. It also works better with most syntax highlighters, and
makes it easier to escape characters, as the escape rules for strings apply,
rather than the different set of rules for literal URLs.</p><p>See the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values/#url-value">URL type</a> documentation
