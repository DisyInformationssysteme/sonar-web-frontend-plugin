/**
 * Helper interface used to access plugins constants. Constants are defined in a
 * static final way that makes impossible to directly access them in an
 * implementation. A specific class will then be used in this implementation.
 * But in our case, we need to have a generic implementation that can use some
 * constant values. These constant values can be provided by 1 or more plugins.
 * So declaring an interface that provide values needed by the implementation
 * and implementing one the interface for each plugin allows us to declare
 * constants (static final) with accessors available at runtime.
