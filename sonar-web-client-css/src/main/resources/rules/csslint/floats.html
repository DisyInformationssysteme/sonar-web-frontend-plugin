      <p>The <code>float</code> property is the most popular method of achieving columnar layouts using CSS. During the course of a project, more and more <code>float</code> elements are used to create ever-different layouts throughout a page or site. This leads to fragile CSS that is easy to break if one aspect of the layout changes.</p>

<p>Frequently, using too many <code>float</code>s is a sign that your project would benefit from a grid system. CSS grid systems standardize columnar layouts using CSS classes. Some popular grid systems are:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li><a href="http://960.gs/">960gs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/">OOCSS Grids</a></li>
<li><a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssgrids/">YUI Grids</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Using one of these grid systems can greatly reduce the amount of CSS code you need to write by hand.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-rule-details" class="anchor" href="#rule-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rule Details</h2>

<p>Rule ID: <code>floats</code></p>

<p>This rule is aimed at reducing complexity by watching how many times <code>float</code> is used. It warns when <code>float</code> has been used more than 10 times. This amount of floats usually indicates that there are a lot of columnar layouts being defined and that a grids system would be a better choice for your CSS.</p>
