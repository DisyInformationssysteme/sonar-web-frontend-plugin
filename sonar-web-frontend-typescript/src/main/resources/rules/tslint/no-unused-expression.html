         <h1 class="post-title">Rule: no-unused-expression</h1>
         <p></p>
      </header>
      

      <p>Disallows unused expression statements.</p>


   
<p>Unused expressions are expression statements which are not assignments or function calls
(and thus usually no-ops).</p>



   <h5>Rationale</h5>
   
<p>Detects potential errors where an assignment or function call was intended. Also detects constructs such as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">new SomeClass()</code>, where a constructor is used solely for its side effects, which is considered poor style.</p>




<h3>Config</h3>
<p>Not configurable.</p>


<h5>Examples</h5>

<pre>"no-unused-expression": true<br/></pre>


<h5>Schema</h5>
<pre>{}<br/></pre>
